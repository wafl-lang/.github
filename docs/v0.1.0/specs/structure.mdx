# Document structure

## Header

- Optional first line: `%WAFL 0.x`. If present, it must match the `0.x` pattern. Files without the header are still valid.

## Directives

Directives live at the top level and start with `@`.

| Directive | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| `@import` | Include and merge other WAFL files before applying the current one. |
| `@schema` | Declare reusable type definitions (see Validation). |
| `@eval` | Reserved for future evaluation hooks; currently carried as metadata. |

## Sections and keys

- A section (object) ends with `:`:

```wafl
app:
  name: "WAFL Demo"
```

- Keys can carry a type annotation in angle brackets: `app<App>:`. The `<App>` suffix is stripped in the resolved data but kept for validation metadata.

## Indentation

- Indentation defines nesting. Decreasing indentation closes the current block.
- Tabs and spaces are both supported; be consistent within a file.

## Comments & blank lines

- Lines starting with `#` are ignored.
- Blank lines are allowed anywhere and do not affect structure.
