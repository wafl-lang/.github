# Collections

## Objects

| Rule | Example |
| ---- | ------- |
| Indent child keys under a parent. | `theme:`<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;`primary: "#fff"`<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;`secondary: "#111"` |
| Objects can be nested freely (type annotations still apply). | `app<App>:` nests regular keys below it. |

## Lists

| Rule | Example |
| ---- | ------- |
| Start each item with `-`. | `features:`<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;`- login`<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;`- analytics` |
| Gate an item with `if`. | `features:`<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;`- login`<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;`- if $ENV.NODE_ENV === "dev": monitoring` |

Only truthy conditions are kept in the final data; falsy items are removed.
