# Expressions

Use `=` to mark a value that must be evaluated.

```wafl
port = $ENV.PORT || 3000
debug = $ENV.NODE_ENV === "dev"
```

## Environment variables

- `$ENV.KEY` substitutes environment values provided at load time.
- A shorthand fallback is supported: `$ENV.KEY || default`.
- Missing variables are treated as `null`.

## Operators

| Operators | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==` | Equality and inequality (`===`/`!==` normalize to `==`/`!=`). |
| `&&`, `||` | Logical AND/OR (`&&` is treated as `and`). |
| `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` | Arithmetic. |

## Evaluation rules

- Expressions are parsed as strings, then evaluated with the provided environment map.
- Failures log a warning and return the unevaluated string to keep issues visible.
