# Directives

Directives live at the top level and start with `@`. They shape how multiple files are combined and how data is validated.

| Directive | Purpose | Accepted values |
| --------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `@import` | Include and merge other WAFL files before applying the current one. | String path or array of string paths. |
| `@schema` | Declare reusable types for validation. | Object whose keys are type names. |
| `@eval` | Reserved for future evaluation hooks; currently stored as metadata only. | Any value; currently unused. |

## @import

- Include other WAFL files before applying the current file.
- Accepts a string or an array:

```wafl
@import: schema.wafl
# or
@import:
  - base.wafl
  - env/dev.wafl
```

- Imported documents are deep-merged. Later files override earlier ones; the current file overrides everything imported.

## @schema

- Declares reusable types for validation.

```wafl
@schema:
  App:
    name: string
    version: string
    port: int
    debug?: bool
    features: list<string>
```

- Combine with type-annotated keys (e.g., `app<App>:`) so values can be checked against the matching schema entry.

## @eval

- Reserved for future evaluation hooks. It is parsed and stored as metadata but not executed by the language runtime today
