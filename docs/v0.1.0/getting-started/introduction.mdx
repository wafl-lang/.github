# Introduction

**WAFL (Wider Attribute Formatting Language)** is an indentation-based configuration format with expressions, imports, schemas, and tags. This guide focuses on the document format itself, leaving implementation details to separate developer guides.

| Concept | Details |
| ------- | ------- |
| Readable blocks | Sections end with `:`, and indentation defines nesting. |
| Expressions | `=` marks evaluable code with access to `$ENV`. |
| Imports & schemas | `@import` composes files; `@schema` declares reusable types. |
| Tags | `!tag(...)` generates values (e.g., `!rgb(255,200,80)`). |
| Conditionals | List items can be gated with `- if <expr>: value`. |

Use the sections below to learn each part of the language.
